# GNU-Radio-FM-Radio-FFT
a simple FM radio receiver single channel FFT analyzer that I am using as my icebreaker for learning SDR. This is a simple RTL SDR source that is tuned to 107.9 MHz, a prominent FM radio channel in my area. It displays an FFT GUI that shows the powerful signal in relation to its surrounding bandwidth.
